        <h3>6:00 pm - Welcome Party</h3>
          <p>For all the guests arriving on Thursday, we will have an unofficial get together before going out to the strip. We booked a large room at the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas with a 400 square feet terrace overlooking the Bellagio fountains to receive any guests that would like to join us. Contact either of us to guide you to our room location!</p>

          <h3>10:00 pm - Explore Las Vegas</h3>
          <p>Once we are all together, we'll go and explore the Las Vegas scene. We can watch the Bellagio fountains show, visit the botanical gardens, and take pictures with the Caesar's palace statues and the Eiffel Tower. Maybe we can even go to the club if everyone is down. We are open to any other activity suggestions!</p>
